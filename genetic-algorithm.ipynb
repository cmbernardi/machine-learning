Finally, the two halves are concatenated to form the new child solution.\n\n    - The result of this step is a subset of new child solutions of size desired_length\n\n- Mutation: This step includes the mutation of a random gene in some child solutions.

If this event happens, a random gene in this solution is inverted.

It calls two important functions in the algorithm: initialization and evolution. The steps of the main function are as follows:\n\n**This main function starts by setting some values like the knapsack maximum capacity KCap, number of solutions in the population POP_SIZE, the number of generations GEN_MAX, and the number of items to be considered NUM_ITEMS in each processing the step.**\n\n- It creates a list of items of size (NUM_ITEMS); each item has a random weight and value from 0 to 20.\n\n(random.randint(0,20), random.randint(0,20))\n\n- Initialization. The main function starts the genetic algorithm by creating an initial population via a call to the Initialization function.\n\npopulation = Initialization(POP_SIZE, NUM_ITEMS)\n\nThen the function processes a series of steps in a loop that is repeated GEN_MAX number of times.\n\n- Fitness. The fitness of each solution in the population is calculated, then the whole population is sorted according to the calculated fitness.\n\nfitness(ind, ITEMS, KCap): the fitness function measures the fitness of an individual according to the weights and values of the items in this individual.\n\n- Selection, crossover, and mutation. The function then calls the Evolution function which includes the selection, crossover and mutation steps. The input parameter of the Evolution function is the sorted population.\n\n- Replace. The Evolution function returns a new generation of the population. This new population replaces the old one.\n\npopulation = Evolution(population)\n\n- The total fitness of the population is counted and printed for each generation. According to the genetic algorithm steps, the total fitness should be increasing gradually.\n\nfor i in population:\n\ntotalFitness += fitness(i, ITEMS, KCap)\n\nThe printed totalFitness is increasing gradually as follows: the total fitness of the initial population (i.e., 210), then the total fitness values of the next populations are (i.e., 559, 1673, 2135, 2411, 2476, 3085, 3120).\n\n**Finally, this function ends up with a child population (The GEN_MAX’s (50th) generation) that includes the best solution to the problem that has been found in the last iteration. The population is sorted again in a descending order according to the total weight of each solution using the fitness function. The first chromosome in this population represents the optimal solution having the highest total value of that generation.**\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def main():\n\n    KCap = 50\n\n    POP_SIZE = 30\n\n    GEN_MAX = 50\n\n    NUM_ITEMS = 15\n\n    ITEMS = [(random.randint(0,20),random.randint(0,20)) for x in range (0, NUM_ITEMS)]\n\n    generation = 1 #Generation counter\n\n    population = Initialization(POP_SIZE, NUM_ITEMS)\n\n    for g in range(0,GEN_MAX):\n\n        population = sorted(population, key=lambda ind: fitness(ind, ITEMS, KCap),reverse=True)\n\n        totalFitness = 0\n\n        for i in population:\n\n               totalFitness += fitness(i, ITEMS, KCap)\n\n        population = Evolution(population)\n\n        generation += 1\n\n    population = sorted(population, key=lambda ind: fitness(ind, ITEMS, KCap), reverse=True)\n\n    print(population[0])","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":33,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"main()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
